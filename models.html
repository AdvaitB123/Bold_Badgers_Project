                                <p>A Decision Trees are useful machine learning tools for making decisions and categorizing data. They create a tree-like strucutre by dividing data based on important features, forming decision nodes and leaf nodes. The algorithm keeps splitting the data until it reaches a stopping point, resulting in easy-to-understand models that handle different types of data. Decision trees find applications in various fields and are great for solving classification and regression problems by capturing complex relationships in the data</p>

                                    A Random Forest is a popular machine learning model that belongs to the ensemble learning family. 
                                    It is used for both classification and regression tasks. 
                                    The fundamental idea behind a Random Forest is to combine the predictions of multiple individual decision trees to create a more accurate and robust overall prediction.</p>

                                    Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a fundamental optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning and neural network training. Unlike conventional gradient descent, which processes the entire dataset in each iteration, SGD takes a more computationally efficient approach by randomly sampling individual data points or small batches for updating model parameters. This randomness introduces noise, causing the optimization path to oscillate around the true gradient, but this trade-off enables faster convergence, especially on large datasets. By updating the model parameters based on the gradients of the selected data points, SGD continually adapts and refines the model, eventually finding the optimal solution. Additionally, variants like Mini-batch SGD strike a balance between computation and convergence speed, making SGD a versatile and widely adopted optimization technique in the field of machine learning.

                                <p>Some of the models, such as the Multi Layer Perceptron neural network, overfit to the training data and have extremely bad validation scores. The overfitting can most likely be attributed to the small dataset size, although most models handled the size of the data very well. Most of the SKLearn models performed very well due to hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV. The neural network, made in Pytorch, was not tuned becuase there was not enough time. It could have been possible to make the neural netowrk model the best performer with better hyperparameter tuning</p>
